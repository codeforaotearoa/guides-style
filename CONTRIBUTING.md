## Open Data Toolkit Styles Gem

This gem contains the styles used in the [Code for Aotearoa](http://codeforaotearoa.org) [Open Data Toolkit](https://github.com/codeforaotearoa/open-data-tool-kit)

It's forked from [18F's guides-style gem](https://github.com/18F/guides-style) without which, we wouldn't have been able to slap together a nice enough looking toolkit this fast!
